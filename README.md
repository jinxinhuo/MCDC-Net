In our work, we mix central difference convolution and vanilla convolution(CDC-Mix) after considering the depth and 
width features of neural networks and analyzing the influence of attention on network performance. Based on CDC-Mix,
we propose a separable convolution (SeparableCDC-Mix). The proposed method consists of three parts: 
1) CDC-Mix and SeparableCDC-Mix are used to extract the gradient
information and texture features;
2) CDCM is used to extract the
multi-scale information of the image;
3) multi-scale fusion module(MS-Fusion) is used to fuse the multi-scale information from different locations of the network.

A large number of experiments have been carried out on several datasets generated by GAN, and the experimental results show that
the proposed method has a great improvement compared with the existing advanced methods.
